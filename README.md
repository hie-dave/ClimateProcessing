# LPJ-Guess Climate Data Pre-Processor

[![Build](https://github.com/hie-dave/ClimateProcessing/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hie-dave/ClimateProcessing/actions)

This is a CLI app which generates a set of scripts intended to be run on a HPC,
which process a climate dataset for use with LPJ-Guess.

Currently, the only supported dataset is NarCLiM 2.0. Support for other datasets
can be added by implementing the `IClimateDataset` interface for the dataset.

## Running

Run the ClimateProcessing project with `--help` to view CLI arguments. E.g.

```
dotnet run --project ClimateProcessing -- --help
```

## Unit Tests

```bash
dotnet test
```

Code coverage results can be generated by running the `codecoverage` script.
Results will be emitted in `coveragereport/index.html`.
